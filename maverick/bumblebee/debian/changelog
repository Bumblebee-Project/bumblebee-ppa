bumblebee (2.3.0-1~maverickppa1) maverick; urgency=low

  * Initial release
    - Settings are automatically detected, therefore bumblebee-configuration
      has been removed.
    - Power management ("acpi calls") have temporary been removed because of
      its instability.
    - No sudo is needed anymore, the bumblebee daemon will start the X server
      on request.
    - optirun32 and optirun64 have been removed, optirun -32 have been
      deprecated since the use of 32-bit libraries are automatically detected,
    - Added --help options for optirun and bumblebee
    - Trimmed xorg.conf allowing the system to autodetect settings
    - Cleaned up the code, syntax errors do not occur anymore on exceptions
    - Removed VGL_READBACK option as this setting should not be changed. It can
      still be set as environment variable if needed
    - Removed VGL_LOG as it is rarely needed to change. It's also more flexible
      to change it using the --debug-log option of optirun
    - Errors are logged to /var/log/bumblebee.log
    - Better error handling if X fails to start or a driver fails to (un)load
    - Fallback setting FALLBACK_START to configure starting of apps even if
      nvidia cannot be loaded
    - Improved bugreport tool
    - Improved X security by enabling host-based authentication

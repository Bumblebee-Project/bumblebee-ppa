Description: nVidia Optimus support
 Bumblebee aims to provide support for nVidia Optimus laptops. These laptops
 are built in such a way that the nVidia graphics card can usually not be used.
 With Bumblebee, a X server for the nVidia card is started and frames are
 transferred to the Intel GPU using VirtualGL. Power saving is accomplished with
 the bbswitch kernel module. Supported drivers are nvidia and nouveau.

Description: nVidia Optimus support using the proprietary NVIDIA driver
 This package blacklists conflicting drivers such that those will not conflict
 with the proprietary NVIDIA driver. The library paths are set to use the Mesa
 graphics library in order to have accelerated 3D graphics.

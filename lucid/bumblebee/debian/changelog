  * New upstream release
    - Support for primus as an alternative to virtualgl as optirun back-end.
      Added a new Bridge option in bumblebee.conf to set the default back-end
      (auto as default currently, selects VirtualGL if installed, else primus,
      detection order may change in 4.0). optirun gained a -b/--bridge option
      for on-the-fly back-end choice.

      polling.

    - Fixed available drivers detection by supporting module aliases.
  * Ubuntu changes

      modprobe blacklist file and a new upstart initscript for driver detection.
  * debian/control:
    - Suggest primus.

bumblebee (3.0.1-2~lucidppa1) lucid; urgency=low
  * debian/patches:
    - add 007-nvidia-fallback-probe.patch: The KernelDriver name could either
      be nvidia, nvidia-current or nvidia-current-updates, depending on where
      you get it from (xorg-edgers, ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates), and which version
      you have. We use nvidia-current as default because this is the most
      common value, but as it may change, we try the other ones in case it
      fails.
  * updated buildscript in order to respect standards:
    - Standards-Version set to 3.8.4
    - updated copyright to 2012 and added myself to it
    - removed useless prerm script
    - removed useless call to ldconfig in bumblebee-nvidia
    - set bumblebee-nvidia as a meta-package

bumblebee (2.3.0-1~lucidppa1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Initial release
    - Settings are automatically detected, therefore bumblebee-configuration
      has been removed.
    - Power management ("acpi calls") have temporary been removed because of
      its instability.
    - No sudo is needed anymore, the bumblebee daemon will start the X server
      on request.
    - optirun32 and optirun64 have been removed, optirun -32 have been
      deprecated since the use of 32-bit libraries are automatically detected,
    - Added --help options for optirun and bumblebee
    - Trimmed xorg.conf allowing the system to autodetect settings
    - Cleaned up the code, syntax errors do not occur anymore on exceptions
    - Removed VGL_READBACK option as this setting should not be changed. It can
      still be set as environment variable if needed
    - Removed VGL_LOG as it is rarely needed to change. It's also more flexible
      to change it using the --debug-log option of optirun
    - Errors are logged to /var/log/bumblebee.log
    - Better error handling if X fails to start or a driver fails to (un)load
    - Fallback setting FALLBACK_START to configure starting of apps even if
      nvidia cannot be loaded
    - Improved bugreport tool
    - Improved X security by enabling host-based authentication

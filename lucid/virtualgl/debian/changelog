virtualgl (2.3.2-1~lucidppa1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Removed patches trunk-rev4814-sdl-fixes.patch and
      virtualgl-fix-windows-deletion.patch
    - Advertise GLX_ARB_create_context_profile extension support
    - Use a separate OpenGL context to perform pixel readback. This fix a lot
      of issues, including "GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object extension not available"
      when trying to enable PBO readback with applications that use a 3.x or
      later OpenGL core profile.
    - glXUseXFont() has been extended to work with Pbuffers. VirtualGL would
      previously abort with an error message if the 3D application attempted
      to render text to a Pbuffer that it created.
    - Previously, 3D applications running in VirtualGL could not successfully
      use XGetImage() to obtain the rendered 3D pixels from a GLX pixmap. This
      has been fixed.

  * debian/patches/vgl-2.2.90-head.patch: Sync with HEAD at 23 August 2011
    - Fixed a GL_INVALID_OPERATION error that would occur after a call to
      glXSwapBuffers() when a context with the OpenGL Core Profile was being
      used.
    - glXChooseFBConfig() and glXChooseFBConfigSGIX() were erroneously
      returning an error when a NULL attribute list argument was passed to
      them. They now behave correctly.

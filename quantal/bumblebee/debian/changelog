bumblebee (3.0.1-2~quantalppa1) quantal; urgency=low
  * debian/patches:
    - add 007-nvidia-fallback-probe.patch: The KernelDriver name could either
      be nvidia, nvidia-current or nvidia-current-updates, depending on where
      you get it from (xorg-edgers, ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates), and which version
      you have. We use nvidia-current as default because this is the most
      common value, but as it may change, we try the other ones in case it
      fails.
  * updated buildscript in order to respect standards:
    - Standards-Version set to 3.9.3
    - compat set to 9
    - debhelper dependency set to 9.0.0~
    - updated copyright to 2012 and added myself to it
    - removed useless prerm script
    - removed useless call to ldconfig in bumblebee-nvidia
    - set bumblebee-nvidia as a meta-package
    - fixed lintian error with setting Pre-Depends on dpkg

virtualgl (2.3.2-1~quantalppa1) quantal; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Removed patches trunk-rev4814-sdl-fixes.patch,
      virtualgl-fix-windows-deletion.patch and
      004-fltk-fix-compiler-warnings.patch
    - Advertise GLX_ARB_create_context_profile extension support
    - Use a separate OpenGL context to perform pixel readback. This fix a lot
      of issues, including "GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object extension not available"
      when trying to enable PBO readback with applications that use a 3.x or
      later OpenGL core profile.
    - glXUseXFont() has been extended to work with Pbuffers. VirtualGL would
      previously abort with an error message if the 3D application attempted
      to render text to a Pbuffer that it created.
    - Previously, 3D applications running in VirtualGL could not successfully
      use XGetImage() to obtain the rendered 3D pixels from a GLX pixmap. This
      has been fixed.

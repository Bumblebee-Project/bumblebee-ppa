virtualgl (2.2.90-1~oneiricppa5) oneiric; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/vgl-2.2.90-head.patch: Sync with HEAD at 23 August 2011
    - Fixed a GL_INVALID_OPERATION error that would occur after a call to
      glXSwapBuffers() when a context with the OpenGL Core Profile was being
      used.
    - glXChooseFBConfig() and glXChooseFBConfigSGIX() were erroneously
      returning an error when a NULL attribute list argument was passed to
      them. They now behave correctly.

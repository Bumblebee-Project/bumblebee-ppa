bumblebee (3.2.1-1~raringppa1) raring; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - fixed Bumblebee 3.2 not working on a lot of setups. This happened because
      of "Device" section splitting in xorg conf files.
    - fixed an issue where an empty XorgModulePath lead to -isolateDecide being
      removed from Xorg start command line instead of -modulepath.

bumblebee (3.2-1~raringppa1) raring; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - implemented -b none option for optirun to disable injection of any render
      offloading bridge (primus or VirtualGL). Use this to invoke
      nvidia-settings (optirun -b none nvidia-settings -c :8).
    - implemented --no-xorg option for optirun to disable starting secondary X
      server. Use this to run CUDA or OpenCL applications that do not need the
      graphics rendering capabilities. Implies -b none.
    - added support for passing -configdir to X, defaulting to
      /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.d, --xconfdir option added to bumblebeed and
      XorgConfDir added to bumblebee.conf; this finally fixes a long-standing
      annoyance with SNA config option for the Intel driver.
    - minor changes in xorg.conf files: unified Device[01] toDiscreteNvidia,
      moved BusID to xorg.conf.d/busid.conf.
    - added --primus-ldpath and PrimusLibraryPath options to set
      PRIMUS_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    - we do not depend on primusrun script anymore for primus backend, note
      that primusrun and optirun -b primus will have different behavior, the
      first one will power on the discrete GPU when needed, while the second
      one will do it immediately; the difference in behavior is most noticeable
      with WebGL content in Firefox.
    - added /usr/$LIB/mesa/libGL.so.1 to default primus libGLd for supporting
      Ubuntu 13.04.
    - fixed --pidfile documentation.
    - fixed a "buffer overflow" issue in bumblebeed.
    - removed accesses to PCI config space from the daemon process.
